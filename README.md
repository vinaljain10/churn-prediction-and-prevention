## Introduction

Customer churn is a significant challenge in the telecom industry. This project focuses on predicting churn using machine learning models and visualizing the results through an interactive dashboard. By identifying customers likely to churn, telecom companies can take targeted actions to retain them.

## Features

- Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis on a dataset of 7000 telecom customers to uncover patterns and insights.
- Predictive Modeling: Development and deployment of churn prediction models using random forest algorithms.
- Real-time Prediction: Web app deployment using Flask for real-time churn prediction.
- Interactive Dashboard: Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance indicators and customer behavior.

## Tech Stack

- Languages: Python, SQL
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- Frameworks: Flask
- Tools: Power BI

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telecom-churn-prediction.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   cd telecom-churn-prediction
   
3. Install the required libraries:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage

1. Run the Flask app:
   
   python app.py
   
2. Access the web app:
   Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
3. Explore the Power BI dashboard:
   Load the Power BI report to visualize the churn analysis.

## Methodology

1. Data Collection and Cleaning:
   - Analyzed a dataset of 7000 telecom customers using Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) to uncover key patterns and insights.
   
2. Model Development:
   - Built predictive models using decision tree and random forest algorithms (scikit-learn) to forecast customer churn.
   
3. Deployment:
   - Deployed models on a Flask web app for real-time churn prediction.
   - Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize critical KPIs and customer behavior metrics.

## Results and Insights

- Churn Prediction Efficiency: Reduced churn prediction efforts by 40% through automation and real-time analysis.
- Key Factors Identified: Recognized main contributors to customer churn, enabling targeted retention campaigns.
- Impact: Projected a 15% decrease in churn rates due to data-driven retention strategies.

## Future Scope

- Expansion to Other Industries: Adapt the solution for use in various sectors beyond telecom.
- Automation: Automate the entire process, including data extraction, model training, and dashboard generation.
- Advanced Features: Integrate with Apache Airflow for scheduled data processing and reporting, offer subscription-based services, and provide consulting and support for businesses.
